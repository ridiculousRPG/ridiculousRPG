# Starts the engine in debug mode
#DEBUG=true

# You are welcome to specify your own title for the game (optional)
#TITLE=My Own Game

# Change the resolution if you want (default = 640x480)
WIDTH=800
HEIGHT=600

# Starts the game in fullscreen mode (default = window mode)
# The game service "ToggleFullscreenService" allows the user to toggle
# between window mode and fullscreen mode.
#FULLSCREEN=true

# Sets the rendering backend (default = LWJGL)
# At this time JOGL, LWJGL and ANDROID are supported. The engine will automatically
# switch to ANDROID backend if it runs on the mobile Android operating system.
# Therefore you have only the decision between JOGL and LWJGL on the desktop-pc.
# BACKEND=JOGL

# Changes the resizing behavior when the user resizes the window.
# Per default the resolution will always keep the specified width and height.
# This is done by stretching and compressing the content.
# If your game allows dynamic resolutions you can set this to true.
#RESIZE=true

# Per default the rendering engine uses OpenGL 1.1
# You can set this to true if your game needs OpenGL 2.0
# For compatibility reasons you shouldn't change this unless it's really necessary.
#USEGL20=true

# Vsync matches your monitors refresh rate/frequency, with the games frame rate.
# If benchmarking your system, it should be disabled.
VSYNC=true

# The character encoding used for reading script files. Default=UTF-8
# This property should match your file-encoding.
# (To determine the encoding in eclipse right click on a script file
# and choose the option "Properties")
# For Unix and Mac it should already be UTF-8. Under Windows it's a randomly(?)
# chosen value (maybe ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15 or a Windows proprietary value.
# I think it depends on your country code or whatever)
# I would strongly recommend all Windows users to change their default file
# encoding for eclipse (and any other text editor) to UTF-8 or change to an
# other operating system ;)
#ENCODING=ISO-8859-15

# Changes the scripting factory. The default scripting factory is 
# com.madthrax.ridiculousRPG.ScriptFactory and it uses JavaScript as
# scripting language. Change this if your game uses an other script language
# If you write your own ScriptFactory you have to extend from
# com.madthrax.ridiculousRPG.ScriptFactory and offer an empty public constructor
#SCRIPT_FACTORY=com.madthrax.ridiculousRPG.ScriptFactory

# Path for the initialization script(s). Default = data/scripts/initGame.js
# If you have a large initialization script you can split it up and specify
# a path to the directory instead of a simple file. If you do so i would
# recommend you to add a number as file-prefix for sorting the scripts.
# E.g. 001_initGlobalVariables.js, 002_initServices.js,...
#INIT_SCRIPT=data/scripts/initScripts

# Skin for user interface elements. Used by ActorsOnStageService/StandardMenuService.
# There must be two files. One .png image and one .json configuration file.
# The default location is data/uiskin/skinNormal
#UI_SKIN_NORMAL=data/uiskin/skinNormal2
# Skin for focused user interface elements. Used by ActorsOnStageService/StandardMenuService.
# There must be two files. One .png image and one .json configuration file.
# The default location is data/uiskin/skinFocus
#UI_SKIN_FOCUS=data/uiskin/skinFocus2
