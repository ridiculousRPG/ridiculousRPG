Roughly, yes.

All parts that you include in binary form in your application. See the LGPL 
for details.

No.

The list of modules under LGPL is subject to changes (expansion) without 
notice. It is best to check directly from the source code.

However, in your particluar case, it would probably be far simpler to 
distribute VLC under GPLv3, which is also compatible with ALv2, and is not 
dependent on which VLC plugins are yet under LGPL and which not.
