--------------------- About the different LICENSES -----------------------
This project is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see LICENSE file)

This project links against libvlc (http://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC)
The library libvlc and all the used plugins are licensed under
GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1 (or any later version)
(For example open an arbitrary header file from directory /jni/vlc)
You can find the LGPL-license within the folder "jni" and the folder "lib"!
The LGPL-license has a linking exception which allows me to put this work
under the more generous Apache License.

Important for you:
If you use/modify this project you will not be forced to publish your source
code because the Apache License, Version 2.0 has NO COPYLEFT RESTRICTION.
Be careful if you change anything regarding the linked libraries, because
LGPL is less generous.

------------ Side note about the header files inside /jni/vlc -------------
These header files are shipped because it's easier for other users if they
don't need to worry about offering the header files  when compiling this
project. It's only for build-convenience, which itself is one of the goals
stated by the LGPL license. I will not hesitate to remove these files if
someone from the vlc project will complain about shipping this files,
although I think it would contradict some goals of the LGPL.
The shipping of the header files is currently a legal limbo, as far as I know.
