IMPORTANT NOTE:
This library is ON HOLD!
At the time there is not a single plugin/module for vlc available under LGPL!
That's why all efforts regarding this library are pretty useless!

--------------------- About the different LICENSES -----------------------
This project is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (see LICENSE file)

This project links against libvlc (http://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC)
The library libvlc and all the used plugins are licensed under
GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1 (or any later version)
(For example open an arbitrary header file from directory /jni/vlc)
You can find the LGPL-license within the folder "jni" and the folder "lib"!
The LGPL-license has a linking exception which allows me to put this work
under the more generous Apache License.

Important for you:
If you use/modify this project you will not be forced to publish your source
code because the Apache License, Version 2.0 has NO COPYLEFT RESTRICTION.
Be careful if you change anything regarding the linked libraries, because
LGPL is less generous.
